Universal Turing Machine Simulator

This semester-long project is part of the Software Design course at RWU.

The purpose of the project is to design and implement a software that simulates the Universal Turing Machine learned in the previous Theory of Computation course.

The software design process is heavily emphasized and the implementations will serve as visualization/helper programs in the previous Theory course in the future.

Please see Report for the design process and implementation details as well as output samples and manual.
